I am radically progressive and optimist about the ability
of humans to take care of themselves and change the world
for the better.

After being an outraged teenager and spending years developping
political ideas and building utopies, I finally understood that
finding the means to get somewhere is almost as important as the end.

However, I'm not so sure today about what good politics can
bring. I would be a politician if I thought this was the best
way to achieve improvements to everyone's and our planet's lives.

I still think politics as important and necessary, as it has been
since the beginning of our democratic systems.
Yet, even progressive politicians have a lot of difficulties
to implement what they are elected for (when they are elected).

To bring change at a quicker pace, what the organizations,
entrepreneurs and inventors do can matter as much.
Among other things, technology is leading to a breakthrough for
democracy.

Internet has already started to mutate the way in which citizens
handle political matters. If there are examples when we can say
Internet helped start a revolution, it is mostly a new and
uncontrolled media. For instance, social networks have played a strong
role in the current movement against racist and violent
policemen in the US. Given the importance of Internet, it is
very disturbing that countries such as the UK and France are
now trying to control it.

General tools like social media won't suffice though.
More specialized tools like [Avaaz](https://www.avaaz.org)
as well as day-to-day
activism are needed.

Money is power too. Philanthropists can have a big impact
and big money people who do not use it rightfully
have a large share of responsibility in today's world state.

That's why I'm thriving to invent new ways of having a progressive
impact while also doing some classical political activism.

By the way, we can make the world a better place but we should
worry of not
