Who am I?
---------

I don't like to put people in little boxes and yet,
this is just what I'm about to do to myself.
But rather than giving a few such boxes,
here's a longer list of things I am:

boyfriend, computer scientist, environmentalist, European,
ex-Austinite,
feminist, French, graduate student, [Parisian](/en/paris),
political activist,
researcher, [wannabe world changer](/en/world-changer), young man

If you want to see my curriculum,
please refer to my [LinkedIn page](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/theozim).

Current topics
--------------

Currently, my main interest is
[crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).
I am amazed at a few projects that have enable people,
through online massive collaboration, to create knowledge
in a way that would never have been possible in a pre-web era.
I am convinced that the tremendous possibilities that the internet
opens are far from being unveiled.
In particular, communication and collaboration tools are required
and a lot of them are still to be invented.

I am also [developing mobile apps](/zimmisapps/en)
with my brother as a hobby.

Past work
---------

* Biology
    * During my year in Texas,
	I discovered the field of bio-informatics and computational biology.
    I have been working with Professor Tandy Warnow for one semester
	(after having followed her class during the first semester)
	and I have co-authored two articles
	which are about to appear in conferences:
        * "BBCA: Improving the scalability of *BEAST
		using random binning",
		T. Zimmermann, S. Mirarab, T. Warnow, to appear in RECOMB-CG 2014.
        * "ASTRAL: Genome-scale coalescent-based species tree
		estimation", S. Mirarab, R. Reaz, M. Bayzid, T. Zimmermann,
		M. Swenson, T. Warnow,
        to appear in ECCB 2014.
	* Some works done for Prof. Warnow's class:
		* ["Boosting BAli-Phy with UPP"](/pdf/boosting-bali-phy.pdf),
		[C. Rottner](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/cecilerottner/en), T. Zimmermann,
		with help of N. Nguyen and T. Warnow, class project paper.
		* [Presentation of CABOG](/pdf/presentation-CABOG.pdf),
		a genome assembler.
    * When in high school, I did a report
	[[in French](/pdf/TPE.pdf)] on the adaption of plants
	to a new environment with two classmates.
	* My first internship in a research unit was in middle school
	when I visited a biology/cancer research lab for one week
	[[report, in French](/pdf/stage-IGC.pdf)].
	
* Linguistic
	* I did an internship with Professor Paul Sabatier at LIF
	(_Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale_)
	in Marseille
	in the area of Natural Language Processing.
	I developed an algorithm to infer syntactic transformation
	of a sentence from examples and implemented it in Prolog
	[[report, in French](/pdf/stage-LIF.pdf)].
	* When in primary and middle school,
	I invented a language called Enfantin.
	This paper I wrote [[in French](/pdf/enfantin.pdf)]
	explains everything you need to know about it.
	On a side note, I've never spoken this language fluently
	and I would have had no one to talk to anyways.
	* I like languages in general. I have learned Latin,
	Spanish and English for many years.
	I speak English and French fluently and I love them both.
	I would need to spend some time getting better at Spanish
	and I will love to learn new foreign languages if I have time.
	
* Physics
	* In second year of college studies
	(_maths spé_ at Lycée Thiers, Marseille),
	I worked on my first actual research project.
	The subject was how to adapt a vehicle to the road surface
	(in the context of Shell Eco-Marathon).
	I defended this report [[in French](/pdf/TIPE.pdf)]
	for the competitive exams leading to my admission to
	the [ENS](http://www.ens.fr) (École Normale Supérieure), Paris.
	I have studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the
	variation in running resistance with respect to the type of
	road surface, but also to the tire pressure.
	
* Other computer science works
	* During an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge (England),
	I worked on non-termination proofs,
	under the supervision of Byron Cook
	[[report, in English](/pdf/internship-MSRC.pdf)].
	* I have read and commented many computer science research papers.
	I'm including here a link to one of the first comment I did,
	on a paper in the area of robotics
	[[in French](/pdf/planification-trajectoires.pdf)].

* Developing
	* A number of school/research projects I'm not going to list here.
	* My first programming project
	(winner of the _Concours Innovez des Jeunes Inventeurs_,
	March 2008): Test-Pedago
	[[in French](/test-pedago)]. This is an educative software which
	was used by a school teacher with her students. Some of them
	directly contributed to it by creating a database for French
	verbs conjugation.
	
Interests
---------

Apart from what I've said already, I have a broad range of interests,
including:

* Travels
	* I've been to a lot of western European countries
	as well as to the US and Canada.
	* I lived in four different cities/towns in three different countries
	([Marseille](/en/marseille), France; [Paris](/en/paris), France;
	[Cambridge](/en/cambridge), England; Austin, Texas)
	and I recommend all these places.
	* I also love the cities of [London](/en/london),
	New York, San Francisco, Barcelona and Dublin.
	* With my girlfriend, we took advantage of our year abroad to visit
	a lot of places in Texas and in the US in general.
	Some of the cities I liked most were Houston,
	[San Antonio](/en/san-antonio), New Orleans, Memphis, Washington (DC).
	I would also like to recommend the fantastic National Park system,
	in particular Big Bend National Park, the Natchez Trace Parkway,
	the Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah National Park.

* Reading
	* One of my favorite author is
	[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)
	and I particularly recommend the Robots series
	(most stories are at the crossroad
	between science-fiction and detective stories).
	* A book I read recently and liked a lot is "L'Étudiant Étranger"
	by [Philippe Labro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Labro).
	I had purchased this book eight years
	before but I think I picked the perfect time to read it because it
	echoed my own personal adventure in the US.

* Politics
