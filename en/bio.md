Who am I?
---------

I don't like to put people in little boxes and yet,
this is just what I'm about to do to myself.
But rather than giving a few such boxes,
here's a longer list of things I am:

boyfriend, computer scientist, environmentalist, European,
ex-Austinite,
feminist, French, PhD student,
lgBt, [Parisian](/en/paris),
political activist, programmer,
researcher, teacher,
[wannabe world changer](/en/world-changer), young man

If you want to see my curriculum,
please refer to my [LinkedIn page](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/theozim).
A PDF resume is also available upon request.

Current topics
--------------

I am currently a PhD student in the πr² Inria project-team and the
[IRIF laboratory](https://www.irif.fr/)
of the Paris-Diderot University. My supervisor is Professor
[Hugo Herbelin](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/).
My PhD topic is "Challenges in the collaborative development of a
complex mathematical software and its ecosystem"
(see [poster paper][opensym] at OpenSym 2018).

[opensym]: http://www.opensym.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/OpenSym2018_paper_38-1.pdf

Besides, my main interests are
[crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing), and more generally
mass collaboration using the Web,
[open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
and [open research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).
I am amazed at a few projects that have enabled people,
through online mass collaboration, to create knowledge
in a way that would never have been possible in a pre-web era.
I am convinced that the tremendous possibilities that the Internet
opens are far from being unveiled.
In particular, communication and collaboration tools are required
and a lot of them are still to be invented.

I thrive to make my research as public as possible my publishing
as often and as soon as possible on [public archives][HAL] and/or
through this [blog](/en/blog).

[HAL]: https://hal.inria.fr/search/index/q/*/authFullName_s/Théo+Zimmermann

I frequently contribute to _open source_ projects and publish my own
programs as [free software](https://github.com/Zimmi48).
I also answer questions about FLOSS on
[Open Source SE](http://opensource.stackexchange.com/users/5858/zimm-i48).

I have been teaching since october 2016.

Past work
---------

* Formal maths
    * Before my PhD, I worked with Hugo Herbelin on the automatic
    and transparent transfer of theorems along isomorphisms.
    On this subject, I have written a blog post
    [[in French]({% post_url 2015-04-01-transfert-de-theoremes %})]
    and a working paper:
        * Zimmermann T. and Herbelin H. *Automatic and Transparent Transfer of Theorems along Isomorphisms in the Coq Proof Assistant.*
        Presented at CICM 2015 (work-in-progress track).
        Read it
        on [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01152588)
        or on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05028).

* Biology
    * During my year in Texas,
	I discovered the field of bio-informatics and computational biology.
    I have been working with Professor
    [Tandy Warnow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_Warnow) for one semester
	(after having followed her class during the first semester)
	and I have co-authored two conference papers:
        * Zimmermann T., Mirarab S. and Warnow T.
		[BBCA: Improving the scalability of *BEAST using random binning.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/S6/S11)
		_BMC Genomics 15_, Suppl 6 (2014), S11.
        * Mirarab S., Reaz R., Bayzid M. S., Zimmermann T.,
		Swenson M. S. and Warnow T.
		[ASTRAL: genome-scale coalescent-based species tree estimation.](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/17/i541.long)
		_Bioinformatics 30_, 17 (2014), i541–i548.
	* Some works done for Prof. Warnow's class:
		* ["Boosting BAli-Phy with UPP"](/pdf/boosting-bali-phy.pdf),
		[C. Rottner](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/cecilerottner/en), T. Zimmermann,
		with help of N. Nguyen and T. Warnow, class project paper.
		* [Presentation of CABOG](/pdf/presentation-CABOG.pdf),
		a genome assembler.
    * When in high school, I did a report
	[[in French](/pdf/TPE.pdf)] on the adaption of plants
	to a new environment with two classmates.
	* My first internship in a research unit was in middle school
	when I visited a biology/cancer research lab for one week
	[[report, in French](/pdf/stage-IGC.pdf)].

* Linguistic
	* I did an internship with Professor Paul Sabatier at LIF
	(_Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale_)
	in Marseille
	in the area of Natural Language Processing.
	I developed an algorithm to infer syntactic transformation
	of a sentence from examples and implemented it in Prolog
	[[report, in French](/pdf/stage-LIF.pdf)].
	* When in primary and middle school,
	I invented a language called Enfantin.
	This paper I wrote [[in French](/pdf/enfantin.pdf)]
	explains everything you need to know about it.
	On a side note, I've never spoken this language fluently
	and I would have had no one to talk to anyways.
	* I like languages in general. I have learned Latin,
	Spanish and English for many years.
	I speak English and French fluently and I love them both.
	I am currently working on getting better at Spanish
	and I will love to learn new foreign languages if I have time.

* Physics
	* In second year of college studies
	(_maths spé_ at Lycée Thiers, Marseille),
	I worked on my first actual research project.
	The subject was how to adapt a vehicle to the road surface
	(in the context of Shell Eco-Marathon).
	I defended this report [[in French](/pdf/TIPE.pdf)]
	for the competitive exams leading to my admission to
	the [ENS](http://www.ens.fr) (École Normale Supérieure), Paris.
	I have studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the
	variation in running resistance with respect to the type of
	road surface, but also to the tire pressure.

* Other computer science works
	* During an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge (England),
	I worked on non-termination proofs,
	under the supervision of
    [Byron Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Cook_%28computer_scientist%29)
	[[report, in English](/pdf/internship-MSRC.pdf)].
	* I have read and commented many computer science research papers.
	I'm including here a link to one of the first comment I did,
	on a paper in the area of robotics
	[[in French](/pdf/planification-trajectoires.pdf)].

* Developing
	* A number of school/research projects I'm not going to list here.
	* My first programming project
	(winner of the _Concours Innovez des Jeunes Inventeurs_,
	March 2008): Test-Pedago
	[[in French](/test-pedago)]. This is an educative software which
	was used by a school teacher with her students. Some of them
	directly contributed to it by creating a database for French
	verbs conjugation.
	* [A modern version of the Snake game](/zimmisapps/en) that you
	can play in your web browser on mobile phone, tablet, laptop or desktop.
	* A mass-collaboration novel writing project: unkilodeplumes
	[[in French](https://unkilodeplumes.github.io)].

* As an editor, I contributed to the creation of Kinea, a new plurilingual
[online magazine](http://kinea.media) which provides alternative political
and economical analyses as well as science popularization.

Interests
---------

Apart from what I've said already, I have a broad range of interests,
including:

* Travels
	* I've been to a lot of western European countries, to the US and
    to Canada.
	* I lived in four different cities/towns in three different countries
	([Marseille](/en/marseille), France; [Paris](/en/paris), France;
	[Cambridge](/en/cambridge), England; Austin, Texas)
	and I recommend all these places.
	* I also love the cities of [London](/en/london),
	New York, San Francisco, Barcelona and Dublin.
	* With my girlfriend, we took advantage of our year abroad to visit
	a lot of places in Texas and in the US in general.
	Some of the cities I liked most were Houston,
	[San Antonio](/en/san-antonio), New Orleans, Memphis, Washington (DC).
	I would also like to recommend the fantastic National Park system,
	in particular Big Bend National Park, the Natchez Trace Parkway,
	the Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah National Park.

* Reading
	* One of my favorite author is
	[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)
	and I particularly recommend the Robots series
	(most stories are at the crossroad
	between science-fiction and detective stories).
    I have now also finished the Foundation series.
	* In 2014, I read "L'Étudiant Étranger"
	by [Philippe Labro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Labro)
	and liked it a lot.
	I had purchased this book eight years
	before but I think I picked the perfect time to read it because it
	echoed my own personal adventure in the US.
    Still, "L'Étudiant Étranger" describes a very different world
    as it takes place during the segregation.
    * In a similar vein, I strongly recommend
    ["To Kill a Mockingbird"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird)
    by Harper Lee that I had the pleasure to *listen* too.
    * I was able to further my American history culture with
    ["A People's History of the United States"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States)
    by Howard Zinn.

* Politics
