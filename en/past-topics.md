### Coq

- Before my PhD, I worked with Hugo Herbelin on the automatic and transparent transfer of theorems along isomorphisms. On this subject, I have written a blog post [[in French]({% post_url 2015-04-01-transfert-de-theoremes %})] and a [working paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01152588).

### Computational biology

* During my year in Texas, I discovered the field of bio-informatics and computational biology. I have worked with Professor [Tandy Warnow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_Warnow) for one semester (after having followed her class during the first semester) and I have co-authored two conference papers:
  * Zimmermann T., Mirarab S. and Warnow T. [BBCA: Improving the scalability of *BEAST using random binning.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/S6/S11) _BMC Genomics 15_, Suppl 6 (2014), S11.
  * Mirarab S., Reaz R., Bayzid M. S., Zimmermann T., Swenson M. S. and Warnow T. [ASTRAL: genome-scale coalescent-based species tree estimation.](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/17/i541.long) _Bioinformatics 30_, 17 (2014), i541–i548.

* Some works done for Prof. Warnow's class:
  * ["Boosting BAli-Phy with UPP"](/pdf/boosting-bali-phy.pdf),	C. Rottner, T. Zimmermann, with help of N. Nguyen and T. Warnow, class project paper.
  * [Presentation of CABOG](/pdf/presentation-CABOG.pdf), a genome assembler.

### Linguistic

* I did an internship with Professor Paul Sabatier at LIF (_Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale_) in Marseille in the area of Natural Language Processing. I developed an algorithm to infer syntactic transformation of a sentence from examples and implemented it in Prolog [[report, in French](/pdf/stage-LIF.pdf)].
* When in primary and middle school, I invented a language called Enfantin.	This paper I wrote [[in French](/pdf/enfantin.pdf)]	explains everything you need to know about it. On a side note, I've never spoken this language fluently	and I would have had no one to talk to anyways.

### Physics

* In second year of college studies	(_maths spé_ at Lycée Thiers, Marseille), I worked on my first research project. The subject was how to adapt a vehicle to the road surface (in the context of Shell Eco-Marathon). I defended this report [[in French](/pdf/TIPE.pdf)] for the competitive exams leading to my admission to	the [ENS](http://www.ens.fr) (École Normale Supérieure), Paris.	I have studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the variation in running resistance with respect to the type of road surface, but also to the tire pressure.

### Biology

* When in high school, I did a report [[in French](/pdf/TPE.pdf)] on the adaption of plants	to a new environment with two classmates.
* My first internship in a research unit was in middle school when I visited a biology/cancer research lab for one week	[[report, in French](/pdf/stage-IGC.pdf)].

### Other computer science works

* During an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge (England), I worked on non-termination proofs, under the supervision of [Byron Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Cook_%28computer_scientist%29) [[report, in English](/pdf/internship-MSRC.pdf)].
* I have read and commented many computer science research papers. I'm including here a link to one of the first comment I did, on a paper in the area of robotics [[in French](/pdf/planification-trajectoires.pdf)].

Past software projects
----------------------

* My first programming project (winner of the _Concours Innovez des Jeunes Inventeurs_,	March 2008): Test-Pedago [[in French](/test-pedago)]. This is an educative software which was used by a school teacher with her students. Some of them directly contributed to it by creating a database for French	verbs conjugation.
* [A modern version of the Snake game](/zimmisapps/en) that you	can play in your web browser on mobile phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. It still works perfectly!
* A mass-collaboration novel writing project: unkilodeplumes [[in French](https://unkilodeplumes.github.io)].

Kinea
-----

As an editor, I contributed to the creation of Kinea, a new plurilingual [online magazine](http://kinea.media) which provides alternative political and economical analyses as well as science popularization.
