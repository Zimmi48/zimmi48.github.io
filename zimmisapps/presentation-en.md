Enjoy this fun gaming experience!

###Availability

Touch Snake is available on
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zimmisapps.touchsnake).

It is not available yet on the Apple App Store
because we don't want to pay Apple $99/year for a few more downloads.
If you are an iPhone developper and would like to help, contact us.
Otherwise, you can also buy us an iPhone
and give us an additional 100 bucks and we'll oblige.

Touch Snake is also available as a
[web app](/zimmisapps/touchsnake) for anyone to play.
