###Full description

Touch Snake offers a modern and touch-friendly
version of the classic game of snake.
The specificity of Touch snake compared to the original snake
comes from a head-centered view.
You have to explore a non-fully-displayed map.
Enjoy this fun gaming experience!

###Availability

Touch Snake is available for free on
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zimmisapps.touchsnake).

It is not available yet on the Apple App Store

If you are an iPhone developper and would like to help, contact us.
Otherwise, you can also buy us an iPhone
and give us an additional 100 bucks and we'll oblige.
