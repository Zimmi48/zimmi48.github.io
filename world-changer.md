I am radically progressive and optimist about the ability
of humans to take care of themselves and change the world
for the better.

However, I'm not so sure today about what good politics can
bring. I would be a politician if I thought this was the best
way to achieve improvements to everyone's and our planet's lives.

I still think politics is as important and necessary as it has been
since the beginning of our democratic systems.
Yet, even progressive politicians have a lot of difficulties
to implement what they are elected for (when they are elected).

To bring change at a quicker pace, what the organizations,
entrepreneurs and inventors do can matter as much.

General tools like social media won't suffice though.
More specialized tools like [Avaaz](https://www.avaaz.org)
as well as day-to-day
activism are needed.

Money is power too. Philanthropists can have a big impact
and people with big money who do not use it rightfully
have a large share of responsibility in today's world state.

That's why I'm thriving to invent new ways of having a progressive
impact while also doing some classical political activism.

By the way, we can make the world a better place but we should
worry of not
