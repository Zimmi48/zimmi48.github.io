I am radically progressive and optimist about the ability
of humans to take care of themselves and change the world
for the better.

However, I'm not so sure today about what good politics can
bring. I would be a politician if I thought this was the best
way to achieve improvements to everyone's and our planet's lives.

I still think politics is as important and necessary as it has been
since the beginning of our democratic systems.
Yet, even progressive politicians have a lot of difficulties
to implement what they are elected for (when they are elected).

To bring change at a quicker pace, what the organizations,
entreprenneurs and inventors do can matter as much.

General tools like social medias won't suffice though.
More specialized tools like Avaaz as well as day-to-day
activism are needed.

That's why I'm thriving to invent new ways of having a progressive
impact while I also do some classical poltical activism too.

By the way, we can make the world a better place but we should
worry of not
