Who am I?
---------

I don't like to put people in little boxes and yet,
this is just what I'm about to do to myself.
But rather than giving a few such boxes,
here's a longer list of things I am:

boyfriend, computer scientist, environmentalist, European,
ex-Austinite,
feminist, French, graduate student, [Parisian](/paris-en),
political activist,
researcher, wannabe world changer, young man

If you want to see my curriculum,

Current topics
--------------

Currently, my main interest is
[crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).
I am amazed at a few projects that have enable people,
through online massive collaboration, to create knowledge
in a way that would never have been possible in a pre-web area.
I am convinced that the tremendous possibilities that the internet
opens are far from being unveilled.
In particular, communication and collaboration tools are required
and a lot of them are still to be invented.

I am also developing mobile apps with my brother as a hobby.

Past work
---------

* Biology
    * During my year in Texas, I discovered the field of bio-informatics and computational biology.
    I have been working with Professor Tandy Warnow for one semester and I have co-authored two articles which are about to appear in conferences:
        * "BBCA: Improving the scalability of *BEAST using random binning", T. Zimmermann, S. Mirarab, T. Warnow, to appear in RECOMB-CG 2014
        * "ASTRAL: Genome-scale coalescent-based species tree estimation", S. Mirarab, R. Reaz, M. Bayzid, T. Zimmermann, M. Swenson, T. Warnow,
        to appear in ECCB 2014
    * When in high school, I did a report on the adaption of plants to a new environment with two classmates [in French].
	
* Linguistic
	* I did an internship with Paul Sabatier at LIF in Marseille in the area of Natural Language Processing.
	I developed an algorithm to infer syntactic transformation of a sentence from examples and implemented it in Prolog.
	* When in primary and middle school, I invented a language called Enfantin.
	This paper I wrote about it explains everything you need to know on it [in French].
	On a side note, I never spoke this language fluently and I would have had no one to talk to anyway.
	* I like languages in general. I have learned Latin, Spanish and English for many years.
	I speak English and French fluently and I love them both.
	I would need to spend some time getting better at Spanish and I will love to learn new foreign languages if I have time.
	
* Physics
	* In second year of College studies (_maths spé_ at Lycée Thiers, Marseille), I worked on my first actual research project.
	I defended this report [in French] for the competitive exams leading to my acceptance at the ENS (École Normale Supérieure), Paris.
	
* Other computer science works
	* During an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge, I worked on non-termination proofs, under the supervision of Byron Cook.
	You can read my report [in English].
	* I have read and commented many computer science research papers. Here are some comments of which I am the proudest...

* Developping
	* A number of school/research projects I'm not going to list here.
	* My first programming project: Test-Pedago [in French].
	
Interests
---------

Apart from what I've said already, I have a broad range of interests, including:

* Travels
	* I've been to a lot of western European countries as well as to the US and Canada.
	* I lived in four different cities/towns in three different countries
	(Marseille, France; Paris, France;
	[Cambridge](/cambridge-en), England; Austin, Texas)
	and I recommend all these places.
	* I also love the cities of [London](/london),
	New York, San Francisco and Dublin.
	* With my girlfriend, we took advantage of our year abroad to visit a lot of places in Texas and in the US in general.
	Some of the cities I liked most were Houston, San Antonio, New Orleans, Memphis, Washington (DC).
	I would also like to recommend the fantastic National Park system, in particular Big Bend National Park, the Natchez Trace Parkway,
	the Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah National Park.

* Reading
	* One of my favorite author is
	[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)
	and I particularly recommend the Robots series
	(most stories are at the crossroad
	between science-fiction and detective stories).
	* A book I read recently and liked a lot is "L'Étudiant Étranger"
	by [Philippe Labro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Labro).
	I had purchased this book eight years
	before but I think I picked the perfect time to read it because it echoed my own personal adventure in the US.
